What does SQL stand for?	Structured Query Language
What do you call it when you ask a database a question using SQL?	querying
What are primary keys? Foreign Keys?	Primary keys are the specific column in the database that are completely unique to that row. For example, the ISBN number for books. If it's not unique, we often just use an Integer that increments (think Jane.com orders). The foreign key is a key that helps us relate information in another database (think Rails relationship databases)
How do you end SQL statements?	With a semicolon.
While SQL is not case sensitive, what's a common convention?	SQL keywords are in caps while user-defined words are in lower case.
Single line SQL comments. Multi-line SQL comments.	--<div><br /></div><div>/*</div><div><br /></div><div>*/</div>
Naming conventions for:<div><br /></div><div>table names</div><div>column names</div><div><br /></div>	Table names will be singular (user, email, phone). column names will never be repeated inside of a particular databse.<div><br /></div><div>**Also of note is that there are various tables inside of one database. To access a table:</div><div><br /></div><div>Database.Table</div><div><br /></div><div>To access a particular column:</div><div><br /></div><div>Database.Column</div>
How do you create a database?	CREATE DATABASE someName
How do you create a table in a database?	CREATE TABLE databaseName.tableName (...);<div><br /></div><div>Inside the parenthesis goes the columns</div>
What is XAMPP? What does it stand for?	It is a bundle of software that allows you to set up your computer as a webserver.<div><br /></div><div>X - Cross-platform</div><div>A - Apache</div><div>M - MySQL</div><div>P - PHP</div><div>P - Perl</div>
How will you know if you've got XAMMP running correctly?	"Type in:<div><br /></div><div>http://localhost</div><div><br /></div><div>in your browser and it should take you to a screen that says something like ""Welcome to XXAMP""</div>"
Where do you control XAMPP on your Mac?	"You can go the XAMPP control panel by typing in ""manager-osx"" into your search bar."
What is phpMyAdmin? Where do you find it?	Once you launch your web server using XAMPP, you can go to http://localhost and click on the tab that says phpMyAdmin. I guess this is the interface that allows us to work with the database without having to run it with the added complexity of php scripts.
Where is phpMyAdmin using XAMPP?	localhost/phpmyadmin
What is the auto increment option?	It's an option when you set the column names (says AI with a checkbox). I bet this is the way Jane.com handles order numbers.
What tab do you click on to use the SQL command line?	The SQL tab (after clicking on the table you want to update).
What's the syntax for accessing a database called movies and a table called movies? What if you're already in the movies database?	`movies`.`movies`<div><br /></div><div>`movies`</div><div><br /></div><div>**Of note here is that you use the back-tick character (not single or double quotation marks)</div>
Using the following information, insert the correct things in the database:<div><br /></div><div>Database: movies</div><div>Table: movies</div><div>Columns/Values:</div><div><br /></div><div>movie_id : Auto Increment</div><div>title: Day After Tomorrow</div><div>description: good movie</div>	<div>INSERT INTO `movies`.`movies`</div><div>(`movie_id`, `title`, `description`)</div><div>VALUES</div><div>(NULL, 'Day After Tomorrow', 'good movie');</div><div><br /></div><div>**Of note here is that you use the backticks for the first part and single quotation marks for the second part.</div>
How do you add multiple things to a database using a query?	Add multiple things below VALUES, separated by commas. For example:<div><br /></div><div>INSERT INTO `movies`</div><div>(`movie_id`, `title`, `description`)</div><div>VALUES</div><div>(NULL, 'Sightseers', 'People seeing sights'),</div><div>(NULL, 'Deep Blue', 'Lots of sharks.');</div>
Why do we use the backticks? Are they necessary?	We use the backticks so that if we happen to use a MySQL keyword as a column name, it would still work. If that is not the case, we don't really need to use the backticks.
How would you delete a database if it already exists importing a .sql file?	DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database_name
How would you create a database if it doesn't exist (i.e. you're not sure if it exists)	CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS movies;
How would I get inside of a database from a .sql file? (Think cding into a folder).	USE database_name
How would you createa tabe with an integer id as the primary key, a name that is less than 100 character and can't be null, a birth day, a house with a 255 character limit, and a favorite food with a 20 character limit.	"<div><br /></div><div><img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 8.22.04 PM.png"" /></div>"
What does the asterisk mean in SQL?	All fields.
How would you select all fields (assuming you're already in the database) from the movies table, with the first 30 records?	SELECT *<div>FROM `movies`</div><div>LIMIT 30</div>
How would you select all fields in a table (assuming you're already in the database) ordered by title? Assume the table is called movies	SELECT *<div>FROM `movies`</div><div>ORDER BY title</div>
How would you order from Z to A instead of A to Z?	SELECT *<div>FROM `movies`</div><div>ORDER BY title DESC</div>
How would you display just the titles when selecting something?	SELECT title<div>FROM movie</div><div>ORDER BY title DESC</div>
How would you just select the firstname and lastname fields?	SELECT firstname, lastname<div>FROM movie_goers</div><div>ORDER_BY last_name</div>
How would you only select a particular record? Let's say we only want to select the 'Life of Pie' movie.	"SELECT title<div>FROM movies</div><div>WHERE title = ""Life of Pie""</div>"
"How would you select all movies where the title starts with ""Life"""	SELECT *<div>FROM movies</div><div>WHERE title LIKE 'Life%'</div>
"How would you return any movie that has the word ""cheese"" in it?"	"SELECT *<div>FROM movies</div><div>WHERE title LIKE ""%cheese%""</div>"
How do you update a record in the database with the gui?	Click on the database, then the table, then click on the box you want to edit. After editting it, just leave the box and the record will be updated.
How do we select a list of movies for multiple people at the same time? What about a list that excludes certain people?	SELECT *<div>FROM movie_goers</div><div>WHERE lastname IN ('Seagul', 'Toad', 'Douglas');</div><div><br /></div><div>or SELECT *</div><div>FROM movie_goers</div><div>WHERE lastname NOT IN ('Seagul', 'Toad', 'Douglas');</div>
How do we join multiple commands (i.e We want to select a user's favorite movies but this only selects the movie ids. We then need to use all the ids to select the movie titles that correspond to them.)	SELECT *<div>FROM movies</div><div>WHERE movie_id IN (</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;SELECT movie_id FROM favorites</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;WHERE user_id = 9</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;)</div><div>ORDER BY title</div>
How do you delete everything from the table? How do you delete something from the table?	"DELETE FROM movie_goers<div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>or for just something specific</div><div><br /></div><div>DELETE FROM movie_goers</div><div>WHERE lastname = ""Gaits""</div>"
How would we delete something based on two separate conditions?	DELETE FROM favorites WHERE user_id = 3 &amp;&amp; movie_id = 9
How do you get rid of the data from a table while retaining the structure?	TRUNCATE TABLE tablename
How do you completely get rid of a table? Of a database?	"DROP TABLE tablename<div><br /></div><div>**phpMyAdmin prevents us from dropping a database with the command line so we need to click on databases, select the database with the check box next to it, and then click the ""Drop"" option.</div>"
What are the four things you need in your php file to connect to the database?	server, user, password, and database name
How would you access the database from your php file? Give an example:	You'd have to create a mysqli object. For example:<div><br /></div><div>&lt;?php</div><div><br /></div><div>$dbConnect = array(</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;'server' =&gt; 'localhost',</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;'user' =&gt; 'root',</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;'password' =&gt; '',</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;'name' =&gt; 'test_db'</div><div>);</div><div><br /></div><div>$db = new mysqli(</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$dbConnect['server'],</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$dbConnect['user'],</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$dbConnect['pass'],</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$dbConnect['name']</div><div>);</div><div><br /></div><div>?&gt;</div>
How would you get the database's host info? The number of connection errors? The connection error itself? Suppose you have the following:<div><br /></div><div><div>$db = new mysqli(</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$dbConnect['server'],</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$dbConnect['user'],</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$dbConnect['pass'],</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$dbConnect['name']</div><div>);</div></div>	$db -&gt;host_info;<div>$db -&gt;connect_errno;</div><div>$db -&gt;connect_error;</div>
How would you select all fields from a database using PHP? (Assume the mysqli object is assigned to the variable $db)	"$sql = ""SELECT * FROM `test_db` ORDER BY `name`"";<div><br /></div><div>**The whole command has to be surrounded in double quotes. Then we do:</div><div><br /></div><div>$result = $db-&gt;query($sql);</div><div><br /></div><div>**This queries the database with the command we've saved in $sql. Then we do:</div><div><br /></div><div>while ($row=$result-&gt;fetch_object()) {</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$id = $row-&gt;id;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$name = $row-&gt;name;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$password = $row-&gt;password;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;$secrets = $row-&gt;secrets;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;echo ""$id $name $password $secrets"";</div><div>}</div><div><br /></div><div>**This loops through the entire table we've assigned to $result and assigns each row of the table to the value $row. We can then access the value with the key (i.e. $row-&gt;password where password is the column name). From there we simply decide what to do with the saved values.</div>"
Let's say a value in our table has a character that HTML interprets differently than intended (i.e angle brackets, escape characters, etc.). How would we make it so these don't affect the output?	"Using htmlentities:<div><br /></div><div>$name = htmlentities($row-&gt;name, ENT_QUOTES, ""UTF-8"");</div>"
What is a SQL Injection?	Basically it's a vulnerability where a hacker can put a certain statement into the username and password fields and gain access to everything in our database.
How do you make your login bulletproof to SQL Injections?	"Use prepared statements:<div><br /></div><div>$stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(""SELECT * FROM `test_db` WHERE `name` = ? &amp;&amp; `password` = ?"");</div><div><br /></div><div>**This is the same as a normal select statement except we use the $db-&gt;prepare method and change out the input for question marks.</div><div><br /></div><div>$stmt-&gt;bind_param('ss', $username, $password);</div><div><br /></div><div>**The first bit represents the data type for the following two objects (string, string) followed by the values we got from the user.</div><div><br /></div><div>$stmt-&gt;bind_result($id, $name, $password, $secrets);</div><div><br /></div><div>**Has to be in the same order as the table and use the field names.</div><div><br /></div><div>$stmt-&gt;execute();</div><div><br /></div><div>while ($stmt-&gt;fetch()) {</div><div><br /></div><div>**This is a little different than the other while loop of this kind because we don't need to assign it to a $row variable. We can just use the variable names from the bind_result method.</div><div><br /></div><div>$stmt-&gt;close();</div><div><br /></div><div>**Use that when you're completely done with the variables.</div>"
How would you add data to the database with prepared statement? Let's assume you've already connected to the database and used isset to set $username, $password, and $secrets from a form you received. Here's the info you need:<div><br /></div><div>table name: test_db</div><div>columns in order: id, name, password, secrets</div><div>$db represents the database</div>	"$smtp = $db-&gt;prepare(""INSERT INTO `test_db` (name, password, secrets) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"");<div>$smtp-&gt;bind_param('sss', $username, $password, $secrets);</div><div>$smtp-&gt;execute();</div><div>$smtp-&gt;close();</div>"
How would you redirect back to a page with php?	"At the end of the php file, you would put:<div><br /></div><div>header(""Location: file_name_to_go_to.php"");</div>"
After getting all your files online, how do you get your mySQL database online? (Assuming you're working with php)	"1. Go to your control panel and click on mySQL Databases<div>2. Under create new database, type in a name for the database.</div><div>3. Click on create database.</div><div>4. After getting a confirmation for the database name, click on ""Go Back"".</div><div>5. Lower on the page where it says ""Add New User"", add a username and a password.</div><div>6. Copy the username, password, and database name into a text file so that you have a record of them.</div><div>7. Finally, where it says ""Add User To Database"" select the user and the database and click on ""Add"".</div><div>8. On the next screen, select ""All Privileges"" and then click ""Make Changes"".</div><div>9. Click on ""Go Back"".</div><div>10. Go back to cpanel home.</div><div>11. Now click on phpMyAdmin.</div><div>12. You should now see the name of the database you made on the left.</div><div>13. I guess you can't drop and create databases so easily online so you'll want to comment out the DROP DATABASE, CREATE DATABASE, and USE database_name lines (the first line will read, CREATE TABLE tablename).</div><div>14. Click on the name of the database to get inside of it.</div><div>15. Click on import.</div><div>16. Click on browse.</div><div>17. Open the SQL file and click ""GO"".</div><div>18. You'll get a confirmation screen.</div>"
What's the difference between imperative programming and declarative programming?	Imperative Programming - We have to tell the computer all of the implementation details.<div><br /></div><div>Declarative Programming - We're more descriptive in what we name things but we often don't list out all the details of how we're doing something.</div>
What is a database schema?	It is basically the map for the tables, the respective column names, and the respective data types that your application will need to have.<div><br /></div><div>**While schemas are mutable, it's ideal to not have to change them.</div>
What is the difference between static typing and dynamic typing?	Ruby is dynamic typing...it doesn't require you to specify the data type stored in a particular object.<div><br /></div><div>SQL on the other hand is statically typed where you have to specify the data type that will go into each column.</div>
What are the boolean operators in SQL?	AND, OR, NOT<div><br /></div><div>**Also, you can use all of the equality operators ( &lt; , &gt; , &gt;= , &lt;= , = , != )</div>
What is an inner join?	"<img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 8.33.21 PM.png"" /><div><br /></div><div>Of note here is that JOIN is the same as INNER JOIN.&nbsp;</div>"
What is a full outer join?	"<img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 8.35.13 PM.png"" />"
What is a left outer join?	"<img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 8.36.33 PM.png"" />"
"I don't know how to phrase the next one so here it is:<div><br /></div><div><img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 8.38.29 PM.png"" /></div>"	
"I don't know how I would ask a question about the following so maybe it's better to just have the picture displaying:<div><br /></div><div><img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 8.39.08 PM.png"" /></div>"	
"What does the following do?<div><br /></div><div><img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 8.40.28 PM.png"" /></div>"	It joins everything in TableA with everything in TableB. If both tables had 4 rows, we'd get a joined table that has 16 rows. I like to think of it as the .product Ruby method.<div><br /></div><div>Be careful with this because using it on a large database could get very dangerous, very quick.</div><div><br /></div><div>**Also keep in mind that there isn't any obvious use cases for this one.</div>
What is a self join? What is the best way to describe a self join?	A self join is where you join a table with itself. The best way to think about it is if you imagine the table making a copy of itself and then combining with that new table.
"Use a self join on the following table (called employee):<div><br /></div><div><img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 8.49.14 PM.png"" /></div><div><br /></div><div>to create this table:</div><div><br /></div><div><img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 8.50.11 PM.png"" /></div>"	SELECT<div><br /></div><div>team_member.first_name, team_member.last_name, manager.first_name, manager.last_name</div><div><br /></div><div>FROM&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>employee AS team_member</div><div><br /></div><div>JOIN</div><div><br /></div><div>employee AS manager</div><div><br /></div><div>ON manager.id = team_member.manager_id</div><div><br /></div><div>**Of note here is that the AS is not necessary. You can also write this piece of code without that portion.</div>
How should you name your database tables so that they are prepared for ActiveRecord and Rails?	snake_case and pluralized (musical_instruments, favorite_cats)
Let's say you have a musicians table that belongs to a band table and you want to store a foreign key in the musicians table that refers to the id column of the bands table. What would you name your foreign key?	band_id
"<img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 9.35.46 PM.png"" /><div><br /></div><div>An example of well formatted SQL code.</div>"	
What will the following return in SQL?<div><br /></div><div>NULL == NULL</div>	It will return false because null in SQL is a way to say, 'We don't know what this value is.' Because of that, SQL's logic is that there's no way to determine if two unknown values are equal.<div><br /></div><div>The solution to that, if you're looking to test if a value is/isn't NULL is to write:</div><div><br /></div><div>IS NULL</div><div><br /></div><div>IS NOT NULL</div>
What is the PostgreSQL CASE expression syntax?	"CASE<div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;WHEN condition1 THEN result_1</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;WHEN condition2 THEN result_2</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;ELSE result_n</div><div><br /></div><div>END</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>**Here's an example of how that would look. Also note that you can do this the Ruby way where you put the expression to be evaluated on the CASE line (i.e. rental_rate) and the value you're looking for on each WHEN line:</div><div><br /></div><div><img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-03 at 9.48.35 PM.png"" /></div>"
What does the COALESCE function do?	It selects the first non-null value. Here's an example:<div><br /></div><div>SELECT</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;COALESCE (1,2);</div><div><br /></div><div>And here's an example of a practical example. Imagine we want to use an excerpt from a blog post but if the excerpt is not provided (table contains NULL) we want to create an excerpt from the first 150 characters of a blog post.<br /><div><br /></div><div>SELECT</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;COALESCE (excerpt, LEFT(CONTENT, 150))</div><div>FROM</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;posts;</div></div>
What is PostgreSQL?	It is a command-line interface to your database.
How do you create a database with PostgreSQL? How do you connect to your newly created database? How do you list the tables in the database?	After launching the command line with PostgreSQL:<div><br /></div><div>CREATE DATABASE database_name</div><div><br /></div><div>psql database_name</div><div><br /></div><div>\d</div>
How do you escape from postegreSQL in the CLI? Also, what the heck is a CLI.	Command Line Interface<div><br /></div><div>\q</div>
How would you search for things that are between two values in SQL?	col_name BETWEEN 1 AND 10<div><br /></div><div>or</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10</div>
How would you check if a particular column doesn't match a string?	!=
How would you match a string where you know the first two characters but you don't know the third character (and you only want it to be one character)	"LIKE ""AN_""<div><br /></div><div>**Will match AND but not AN.</div>"
How do you just select unique values from a database?	SELECT DISTINCT director<div>FROM movies;</div><div><br /></div><div>**The DISTINCT portion is most applicable here.</div>
How would you select rows 5-10 after you've sorted the database alphabetically (i.e. a primary key won't work)	SELECT title<div>FROM movies</div><div>ORDER BY title ASC</div><div>LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;</div><div><br /></div><div>**The OFFSET 5 is the important part here.</div>
What is database normalization?	It is the process of dividing a database into tables so that one table can grow independent of another table. The only downside is it makes our database queries a little more complex.
What should you add into the SELECT statement if an expression is given as well?	An alias. For example:<div><br /></div><div>SELECT home_value - 100 AS home_value_minus_one_hundred</div>
How would you get the count, min, max, sum and average for a particular column?	"<img src=""Screen Shot 2017-02-04 at 1.19.05 PM.png"" />"
How would you group aggregate functions?	GROUP BY column_name
"What will this piece of code do?<div><br /></div><div><div>SELECT role, SUM(years_employed)</div><div>FROM employees</div><div>GROUP BY role</div><div>HAVING role = ""Engineer"";</div></div>"	"It will sum all of the roles, grouped by role, and then only give us the role that equals ""Engineer"""
How do you do a string in an sql query?	With single quotes, not double quotes. This is important because the query itself (in Rails and PHP) will have the query inside of double quotes so you would need to the string inside single quotes.
What is the order of operations for SQL? Perhaps more importantly, why is it important to know about this order?	FROM<div>ON</div><div>JOIN</div><div>WHERE</div><div>GROUP BY</div><div>HAVING</div><div>SELECT</div><div>DISTINCT</div><div>ORDER BY</div><div><br /></div><div>The biggest reason to know about this order is because it helps us think logically about what is happening at every step. Especially with regards to the SELECT statement, don't even worry about writing anything inside of that block until you've completed the other blocks.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you can think about these things in order, it will make a lot more sense what is being selected and the best way to accomplish the given task.</div>
Let's say we have a three tables in our database: a movies table, an actors table, and a table that connects these two. If that's the case, what does the movies.* do in the following query?<div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SELECT</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; movies.*</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FROM</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; movies</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JOIN</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; castings ON castings.movie_id = movies.id</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JOIN</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; actors ON actors.id = castings.actor_id</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WHERE</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; actors.name = 'Julie Andrews'</div></div>	After doing the join and evaluating all the rows where the name is comparable to 'Julie Andrews', movies.* will select only those things in the matching rows that came from the original movies table.
What's the difference with SQLite and the client-server database engine?	SQLite is embedded into the end application. In other words, the database is embedded with the application and is not kept on a separate server.
What is the advantage of SQLite? Where is it used?	The big advantage is SQLite is a very lightweight way to locally store a database. Basically, you store a database in a file that the user holds onto locally so that the application responds quickly.<div><br /></div><div>This makes the user have a better experience and also ensures that certain functionality is maintained even if there is no network connection to a remote server.</div>
What is a DDL? What is a DML?	DDL - Data Definition Language<div>DML - Data Manipulation Language</div><div><br /></div><div>Think of both of these as containers in computer science that describe one of two things:</div><div><br /></div><div>1. Setting up the structure (creating/dropping tables) for our database.</div><div>2. Manipulating the date (selecting, inserting, updating, deleting) data from our set up structure.</div><div><br /></div><div>**While it may be confusing to call it a language, keep in mind that a language is merely a way to group related content. That's why we call it that word right here.</div>
What is the recipe for a row when you're creating a table (answer this for the primary key row and other rows). Also, how do you add in a foreign key at the bottom?	CREATE TABLE tablename (<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;playwright_id INTEGER NOT NULL</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;FOREIGN KEY (playwright_id) REFERENCES playwrights</div><div>);</div><div><br /></div><div>** Here playwrights would be the other table that this table references&nbsp;</div>
If you establish a table that includes a foreign key at the end, what table would you want to start off putting data into with your .sql file?	The table that holds the foreign key because you can't create anything in the other table until there is something to reference in the table that holds the foreign key.
What's the escape character in SQL if you want to have a single quote inside the string?	Double single quotes:<div><br /></div><div>'Eugene O''Neill'</div>
What does it mean to seed a database?	It means to give it the initial bit of data after you've established the structure of the database.
What is the following doing?<div><br /></div><div>cat import_db.sql | sqlite3 plays.db</div>	It is concatenating (or linking together) the output from our .sql file (a file which in this case creates the database and seeds the database) through sqlite3 (software to create and manage a database in one local file) to this file called play.db (which is stored in our local folder)
How do you gain terminal access to sqlite3 from your terminal? Let's say the local file where the data is stored is in plays.db	sqlite3 plays.db
After gaining terminal access to your database, what command would show you what tables are in that database? (sqlite3)	.tables
How would you see the structure of your database inside sqlite3? What does this look like?	.schema<div><br /></div><div>This will give you the basic outline for your database tables, not necessarily the values in those tables.</div>
How can you do things with your database straight from Ruby (not using Rails). Hint: what gem would you use?	"require 'sqlite3'<div><br /></div><div>** First require the sqlite3 gem. From here, you can store a reference to the database in a variable with:</div><div><br /></div><div>plays_db = SQLite3::Database.new('./file_path.db')</div><div><br /></div><div>** From here you could run a query with that stored database object like so:</div><div><br /></div><div>plays_db.execute(""Some SQL command"")</div><div><br /></div><div>** And you'll get back an array with the results of your query.</div>"
What is Object Relational Mapping?	It is the technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. In simple terms, we can use our preferred object oriented language to manipulate our database without using SQL (in my case using Ruby)
&nbsp;What does the following do?<div><br /></div><div>class PlayDBConnection &lt; SQLite3::Database</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;def initialize</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; super('play.db')</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.type_translation = true</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.results_as_hash = true</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;end</div><div>end</div>	The type_translation ensures that if our data column holds an Integer, we get back an Integer in Ruby. Our results_as_hash Just returns our results from the database as a hash.
What is the singular version of data?	datum
What is a heredoc? What's the standard syntax for using a heredoc as a SQL command?	A heredoc is a way to ensure that what we pass in gets read as a string, even though it is passed over multiple lines. If we use SQL as part of the heredoc, atom colors it to be like SQL code:<div><br /></div><div>PlayDBConnection.instance.execute(&lt;&lt;-SQL</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;INSERT INTO</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; play (title, year, playwright_id)</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;VALUES</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>SQL</div>
What does the following do? (This is at the end of our create method)<div><br /></div><div>@id = PlayDBConnection.instance.last_insert_row_id</div>	This is going to grab the last instance (the one we just created) and assign this to the id of our object.
How would you see the schema for just a particular table using SQLite3?	.schema tablename
What is SQL ternary logic?	It is a many-valued logic system with three truth values: True, False, and Unknown (null).
What command would you use to see all of your databases from the command line? Think postgres	psql<div><br /></div><div>** This gets you in to postgres.</div><div><br /></div><div>\l</div><div><br /></div><div>** That will allow you to see all of the databases you have on your machine.</div>
